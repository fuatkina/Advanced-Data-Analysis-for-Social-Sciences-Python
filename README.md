This course, broadly speaking, is designed to familiarize the student with Python 3 and advanced data analysis techniques. We will cover core programming concepts using Python, which generally apply to programming. These include syntax, data types, functions, loops, and recursion. We will then cover database management, creation, manipulation, and visualization. A brief overview of Statistics, Causal Inference, Spatial Analysis, and Bayesian statistics with an emphasis on practical use will be followed by introductions to the most common machine learning methods. This is a demanding course, with the ultimate goal of a final project with an original analysis testing one or several hypotheses. The course consists of informative lectures on advanced data analysis techniques and helpful hands-on exercises.
